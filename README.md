# Web Guesser
A web-based number guessing game running on Sinatra (Ruby). The game was developed
following the [WebGuesser Tutorial from Jumpstart Labs](http://tutorials.jumpstartlab.com/projects/web_guesser.html), linked to
from The Odin Project's [Sinatra Basic's project](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/ruby-on-rails/lessons/sinatra-basics).
